## How to Use This Book

### 📖 Reading
Each chapter builds on the previous one. We recommend going through them in order, especially if you're new to programming.

### 💻 Running Code
The code examples in this book show real output, but the cells are not interactive. To run the code yourself, copy and paste it into [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) — a free, browser-based Python environment that requires no installation.

### ✏️ Exercises
At the end of each chapter, you'll find exercises to test your understanding. Give each exercise a genuine try before clicking the dropdown to reveal the solution.

## Prerequisites

No prior programming experience is required. However, you should be comfortable with:
- Basic mathematics (arithmetic, percentages)
- Using a web browser
- A willingness to experiment and make mistakes!
