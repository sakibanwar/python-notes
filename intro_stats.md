# Welcome to Python for Statistics & Quantitative Methods

This book is designed for the **Quantitative Methods and Statistics** course at the University of Winchester. Whether you're completely new to programming or brushing up on your skills, this book will guide you step-by-step through Python fundamentals, data analysis, and statistical inference.

**Author:** Sakib Anwar

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this book, you will be able to:

- Write Python programs using variables, functions, and control flow
- Work with data structures like lists and dictionaries
- Load, clean, and manipulate data using pandas
- Create visualisations with seaborn and matplotlib
- Understand the normal distribution, sampling, and the Central Limit Theorem
- Construct and interpret confidence intervals
- Perform hypothesis testing (z-tests and t-tests)
- Run and interpret simple and multiple regression models
- Diagnose regression model assumptions

## How to Use This Book

### Reading
Each chapter builds on the previous one. We recommend going through them in order, especially if you're new to programming.

### Running Code
The code examples in this book show real output, but the cells are not interactive. To run the code yourself, copy and paste it into [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) — a free, browser-based Python environment that requires no installation.

### Exercises
At the end of each chapter, you'll find exercises to test your understanding. Give each exercise a genuine try before clicking the dropdown to reveal the solution.

## Prerequisites

No prior programming experience is required. However, you should be comfortable with:
- Basic mathematics (arithmetic, percentages)
- Using a web browser
- A willingness to experiment and make mistakes!
